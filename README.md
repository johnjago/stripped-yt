[Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/youtube-recommended-videos/)

YouTube is designed to keep you hooked for hours. It's time to take back your
time.

This Firefox extension hides comments and related videos on YouTube, allowing
you to stay focused on the video. Without extra content on the side, the video
is centered by default for a better viewing experience.

It also turns off autoplay and annotations.

There is no configuration. Simply install and enjoy distraction-free YouTube.
