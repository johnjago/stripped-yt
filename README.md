# Stripped YouTube

YouTube's algorithms show you related videos that keep you hooked for hours.
It's time to take back your time.

This Firefox extension hides comments and related videos on YouTube, allowing
you to stay focused on the video you are watching. Without extra content on the
side, the video is centered by default for a better viewing experience.

Why hide the comments? Studies have shown that for the same video on two
different websites, "[personal insults were significantly more prevalent on the
YouTube platform](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0093609#s3)."
