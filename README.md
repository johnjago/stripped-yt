# Stripped YouTube

No related videos, no comments, no autoplay, no annotations, no recommendations
on the home page.

If you want to choose what elements are hidden or want to hide more, check out
*Remove YouTube Recommended Videos, Comments* which is available for both

YouTube is designed to keep you hooked for hours. It's time to take back your
time.

This Firefox extension hides comments and related videos on YouTube, allowing
you to stay focused on the video. Without extra content on the side, the video
is centered by default for a better viewing experience.

Why hide the comments? Studies have shown that for the same video on two
different websites, "personal insults were significantly more prevalent on the
YouTube platform." [[1]](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0093609#s3)
