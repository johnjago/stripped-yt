Stripped YouTube

  YouTube's algorithms are designed to show you related videos that will keep
  you hooked for hours. It's time to take back your time.

  This Firefox add-on hides the comments and related videos on YouTube, allowing
  you to stay focused on the video you are watching.

  Why use this add-on? First, you no longer see the comment section, which has
  been scientifically proven to be more negative (1) than other video sites:
  "Personal insults were significantly more prevalent on the YouTube platform."
  Without the extra content on the side, the video is centered by default for a
  better viewing experience.
