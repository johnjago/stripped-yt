Stripped YouTube
----------------

A Firefox add-on that hides the following on YouTube watch pages:

  * Comments
  * View counts
  * Likes and dislikes
  * Subscriber counts

Why use this add-on? The first benefit is that you no longer see the comment
section, which has been scientifically proven to be negative: "Personal insults
were significantly more prevalent on the YouTube platform".

Another benefit is that videos are no longer a popularity contest, so you can
watch them for the content, not because they have a high view count.
